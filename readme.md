This Project was created given the following constraints. 

Without using any frameworks create a PHP application from scratch that:
1) has a form with the following inputs: username, email address, image upload
2) submit form and validate inputs
3) show validation messages in form
4) resize image if it has more than 300x300 size (In Progress)
5) send email notification to email address that the form was submitted successfully (In Progress)
6) has admin dashboard (password protected) that allows admins to view form submissions and export form submissions to CSV file

To test simply clone to any webserver public directory that is php friendly and make sure file paths are correct.
This solution writes to the file system and does not require a database to store the images or form submitted data.
Enjoy!
